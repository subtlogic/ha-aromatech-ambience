"""Light entity for the AromaTech Ambience.

The device's light frame is `04 <R> <G> <B> <brightness> <mode>`, which maps
onto Home Assistant's light model almost exactly - so this is a light entity
with a colour wheel, not the select it started as.

Mode 4 (Custom) is the only one that honours the RGB bytes. The presets - Warm,
Cool, Flow - ignore them, so they are exposed as *effects*, which is how Home
Assistant models "a fixed look the device produces itself". Choosing a colour
implies Custom; choosing an effect leaves the stored colour alone.
